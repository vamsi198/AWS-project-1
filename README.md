Designing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) - Learning Management System (LMS)

This project focuses on creating a well-structured Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for hosting a Learning Management System (LMS) on a cloud platform. 
The VPC will provide the networking foundation required to ensure the secure, efficient, and reliable operation of the LMS. 
The project encompasses the creation of VPCs, subnets, internet gateways, route tables, Network Access Control Lists (NACLs), and security groups to establish a robust infrastructure for the LMS.
Learning Management System (LMS) has backend(public), frontend(public), and database(private), each operating within dedicated subnets.
backend(public) port is 8080 (Nodejs)
frontend(public) port is 80 (Nginx)
database(private) port is 5432 (Postgres)
